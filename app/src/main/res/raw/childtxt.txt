Teacher: Oh, hi. What was your name again. I can't keep straight all the students' names this being the second day of school.

Student: It's okay. I have a hard time remembering names myself.

Teacher: How, uh, Karen, right?

Student: No, it's Nancy. My mom's name is Karen.

Teacher: Nancy. Okay. I think I heard you were from England.

Student: Well, I was born there, but my parents are American. I grew up in France.

Teacher: Oh, a world traveller!

Student: But then we moved here when I was nine.

Teacher: So, what does your father do now?

Student: Well, he's a college professor, and he is in Scotland at the moment.

Teacher: How interesting. What does he teach?

Student: Oh, I haven't a clue. Nah, just joking. He teaches chemistry.

Teacher: Oh, chemistry, and uh, what about your mother?

Student: She works full time at home.

Teacher: Oh, and what, does she have her own business or something?

Student: Nah, she takes care of me.

Teacher: Well, being a homemaker can be a real hard, but rewarding job.

Student: I think so too.
