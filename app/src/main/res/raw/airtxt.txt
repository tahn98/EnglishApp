Man: Hey. Don't worry. Uh, my brother will meet you at the airport. Sorry, but I have to work that day.
Woman: So, you can't come to get me?

Man: No, uh, sorry.

Woman: Uh, well, um, what does your brother look like?

Man: Well, he's fairly tall, he has short light brown hair, and he's pretty thin. He's certainly not a body builder or pro wrestler.

Woman: Okay. Um, what else?

Man: Oh, and he usually wears a white baseball cap with crazy looking red shoes. I mean, you can't miss him.

Woman: Alright. So, I'm looking for some tall crazy looking guy with wild red shoes who's ready to play baseball?

Man: Exactly.

Woman: And what's his name?

Man: Well, uh, Mike, Michael. He goes by either one.

Woman: Alright.

Man: Alright. Bye.

Woman: (I) Hope he shows up?

Man: Okay, now, I'll call him.

Woman: Alright, bye.

Man: Bye.
