Paul: Sara, I've been looking forward to our yearly campout for three weeks. [Me too] It's going to be a wonderful day for hiking tomorrow. The great outdoors. Camping under the stars . This is the life.
Sara: Yeah, but Paul, I'm a little bit worried about the weather though. The weatherman said it was going to rain later tonight.

Paul: Ah. nonsense. Nothing can spoil our adventure. Those weather reports are never right.

Sara: And it said there was a chance of high winds.

Paul: Ah. Don't worry.

[thunder]

Sara: Paul. Paul. Did you remember to bring our raincoats just in case, like I told you?

[light rain]

Paul: Uh . . . no. I left them on the front porch.

[heavy rain]

Sara: What are we going to do now?

Paul: We'll have to sleep in the car! Hurry get in!

[door shut]

Sara: So, Paul, what are we going to do now?

Paul: How about playing a card game?

Sara: Uhh. I left them next to the picnic table. [Hmmm] Hey, you don't want me to go out in this rain and get them, do you?

Paul: No. That's okay. So what now?

Sara: Well, we could head down the mountain and stay at that hotel we passed on the way up, or go home.

Paul: Hmm, why don't we just make the best of it here and hope the weather clears.

Sara: That's a good idea.
