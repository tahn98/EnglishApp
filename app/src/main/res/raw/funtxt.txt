Girl: Dad, I'm bored today. I want to go to a movie?
Dad: A movie today? Well, I don't know. Here. Let me look at the newspaper. Okay. Ah, here's a movie that starts in the afternoon at 2:45. Well, should we take mommy with us?

Girl: Yeah.

Dad: Okay, we have to wait for mommy because she's at a meeting right now.

Girl: Okay.

Dad: Alright. And what should we do after we see the movie?

Girl: Go on a walk.

Dad: Well, where would you like to go on a walk? Would you like to go down to the beach or through the park?

Girl: To the beach.

Dad: To the beach. Well, that sounds great. And then maybe we can go out to eat tonight. Does that sound okay?

Girl: Yeah.
