Hi everyone. I want to talk about what I do to celebrate the new year. For most people, this will probably sound a little boring, but I prefer to live a simple, yet happy life.
Many years ago when I was much younger, I used to enjoy staying up late with my friends. We would have a party, play games, and eat lots of food. I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure we didn't eat a nice tasty salad with plenty of vegetables in it. Rather, we probably just ate greasy, unhealthy food like pizza, burgers, and drank lots of soda.

Now that I am older, things have changed. When our kids were little, we sometimes stayed up late with them to celebrate the new year, but those times have changed. I find that every day is a new day, and we don't have to wait until the new year to change our lives. Each day gives you a new opportunity to be better.

As of result, we don't do anything special on New Year 's Eve. We generally stay home that evening because there are sometimes careless drivers on the road. We sometimes watch a movie or visit with family, but I usually go to bed before midnight. I'm usually not a late night person, and I would much rather get in bed around 10:00 or so and watch a movie and fall asleep before it's over.

I just enjoy the simple things of life. Happy New Years.
